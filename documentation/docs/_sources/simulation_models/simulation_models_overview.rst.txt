Simulation models
#################

The BeRfiPl simulation consists of four simulation models, which can be interchangeably connected.
The models are derived from a real modular process plant.
Additionally, a ``source`` and a ``sink`` model are introduced, to simulate process plant in- and outputs.

The simulation models own one specific functionality, each, and enable diverging, converging and recurrent product flow.
Each model contains a stategraph for the control of the model and its interconnection.

The available simulation models are:
    - source
        The source model constitutes the input to the simulated Cyber-Physical Process Plant.
        There is no additional functionality.
    - sink
        The source model constitutes the output of the simulated Cyber-Physical Process Plant.
        There is no additional functionality.
    - mixer_partial
        The mixer module can mix the liquids from three tanks into one reservoir tank for further distribution.
    - filter_partial
        The filter module can filter liquids by pumping them from an input tank through a filter into an output tank.
        Based on the passed volume flow, the filter is getting more and more clogged.
        The filter can filter out only one component from the fluid.
    - still_partial
        The still module separates a mixture of fluids with a destillation process.
        The module can separate only one compound from the mixture.
    - bottling_partial
        The bottling module, saves fluid in an input tank, pumps it to a reservoir tank, and bottles it into virtual bottles.
        The bottling is time-dependent. Changes in the volume flow, can interfere with the bottled amount.
    - process_plant
        The process plant module contains the custom process plant, to be simulated.

.. note::
   The \*_partial in the model names refers to only the partial functionality of the real-life model.
   The simulation models themselves are fully functional within their range.
