First steps
###########
Running BeRfiPl simulation models requires the installation of OpenModelica and basic Python libraries.
The requirements and how to install them is explained on this page.

Requirements
************

The requirements to run BeRfiPl comprise:
    - *OpenModelica == 3.2.3*
    - *Python ~= 3.8*
    - *pandas ~= 1.4.2*
    - *plotly ~= 5.6.0*

You can find the python requirements in the ``venv_benchmark.yml`` file.


Installation with Docker
========================
There is a ``Dockerfile`` included in the repository.
Running the dockerfile creates a Docker container, that includes all required dependencies for running BeRfiPl simulations.

To create the Docker container install Docker on your computer. Then, navigate to the repository within your terminal and run:

.. code-block::

   $ docker build -t Dockerfile


Manual installation
===================
You can also manually install the dependencies:

To install the Python requirements miniconda is recommended.
Install `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_ on your computer and navigate to the repository within your terminal.

Create the environment by running:

.. code-block::

   $ conda env create -f venv_benchmark.yml


For manually installing OpenModelica please follow the guidelines stated on the official `website <https://openmodelica.org/>`_.
Especially for manipulating the models an installation of OMEdit is recommended.
